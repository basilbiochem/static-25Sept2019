**Static Version 9.13.19**
This is a static version of the BASIL student manual generated on 9.13.19. If you would like to access the continually updating version of the manual go to https://basilbiochem.github.io/basil/.

This curriculum from the [BASIL (Biochemistry Authentic Scientific Inquiry Laboratory) biochemistry consortium](https://basiliuse.blogspot.com/) aims to get students to transition from thinking like students to thinking like scientists. Students will analyze proteins with known structure but unknown function using computational analyses and wet-lab techniques. BASIL is designed for undergraduate biochemistry lab courses, but can be adapted to first year (or even high school) settings, as well as upper-level undergraduate or graduate coursework. It is targeted to students in biology, biochemistry, chemistry, or related majors. Further details about the BASIL biochemistry consortium can be found on the [BASIL blog](https://basiliuse.blogspot.com/).

The curriculum is flexible and can be adapted to match the available facilities, the strengths of the instructor and the learning goals of a course and institution. These lessons are often used as part of upper-level laboratory coursework with at least one semester of biochemistry as a pre-requisite or co-requisite. The lab has been designed for classes ranging from 10-24 students (working in teams of two or three) per lab section. This lesson can be adapted to laboratory courses for introductory biology, cell and molecular biology, or advanced biology labs.
