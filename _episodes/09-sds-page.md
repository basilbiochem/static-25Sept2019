teaching: 30
exercises: 180
questions:
- "How can SDS-PAGE assess the purity of a protein?"
objectives:
- "Students will understand how acrylamide gels are made and manipulated."
- "Students will be able to estimate protein purity using SDS-PAGE."
- "Students will characterize the size of a protein using SDS-PAGE."
keypoints:
- "To carry out this lab students need vertical electrophoresis equipment."

In this BASIL module, students use Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) as a separation technique to assesses the quality of a protein purification scheme. The approach of this module is to explain the mechanism by which SDS-PAGE is able to separate proteins and demonstrate the importance of this technique by having students run their purification samples on a gel. Students will be required to use SDS-PAGE to determine the purity of their protein samples, evaluate the size of their protein product, and correlate their experimental data with known information regarding the size of their protein.
